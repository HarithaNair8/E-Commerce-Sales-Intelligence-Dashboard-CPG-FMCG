-- join_and_transform.sql
-- SQL script to join HubSpot, ERP, and Nielsen data for unified analysis

-- Assuming the following table structures:
-- hubspot_data(customer_id, contact_name, region, stage, pipeline_value)
-- erp_sales(order_id, customer_id, product_id, revenue, profit, order_date)
-- nielsen_data(region, category, competitor_sales, market_share)

-- Join HubSpot and ERP sales
WITH customer_sales AS (
  SELECT h.customer_id, h.contact_name, h.region, h.stage, h.pipeline_value,
         e.order_id, e.product_id, e.revenue, e.profit, e.order_date
  FROM hubspot_data h
  JOIN erp_sales e ON h.customer_id = e.customer_id
),

-- Join with Nielsen for market comparison
full_sales_view AS (
  SELECT cs.*, n.category, n.competitor_sales, n.market_share
  FROM customer_sales cs
  LEFT JOIN nielsen_data n ON cs.region = n.region
)

-- Final transformation: revenue vs. market benchmark
SELECT 
  region,
  category,
  SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,
  SUM(profit) AS total_profit,
  AVG(pipeline_value) AS avg_pipeline,
  AVG(market_share) AS avg_market_share,
  SUM(competitor_sales) AS total_competitor_sales
FROM full_sales_view
GROUP BY region, category
